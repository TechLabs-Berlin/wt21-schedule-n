# ScheduleN: project description

We started the ScheduleN project because we identified that there was a common problem amongst people when they seek help to change their time management habits - the advice being offered is too generic and it doesn't work. ScheduleN enables the user to learn more about themselves, so that they can change their habits and focus on the important tasks in their lives. Improved time management increases your focus, builds confidence, and allows you to plan your time more effectively.

Our solution is to classify users into different time management personalities, and provide them with personalised advice of how to better manage their time, based on what kind of time management style they have. As a team consisting of UX, DS and WD tracks, we built a website on which users can take a quiz and find out about their time management style. The quiz was created by us after researching online resources. Users only need to go through the quiz, submit their answers and will instantly receive the results with corresponding advice for their time management style. On our website, user can also find out how common their time management style is among the population with time management issue. After taking the quiz, users share their personal experience with time management. We will save these data in our database and analyse them to provide more valid advice for our users in the future version.
