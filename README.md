## General Information

You can find various advice online on how to optimize your time managment, but often people are unable to use that advice effectivly because it is too general for individual circumstances and behaviour. This project aims to give out more personalised advice to users, keep them accountable and update them with new information about their time managment style.

For our first attemp to solve this problem, users can take the quiz and find out about their time mangagement style. Being aware of the type is the first step to takle the issue of having better time management.

Schedule N is an educative project implemented by students of TechLabs Berlin in winter term 21/22.
