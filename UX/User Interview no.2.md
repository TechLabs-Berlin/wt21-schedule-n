User Interview no.2 
To begin, can you please tell me what a typical day looks like for you? (potentialprobes: working or studying? full/part time?)If working: can you tell me a bit about the industry that you work in and your job role? 
I don't really have a typical day, each is different to the next. I work full time, sometimes from home but a few days a week I work away outside of London- I travel a lot by both plane and car. I work in hospitality, organising events and managing teams of people who run restaurants and manage events. 
What kind of tasks do you perform the most? (if needed can prompt: working, 
studying, childcare, shopping, etc) 
I spent a lot of time working, so work tasks- booking in meetings, organising my week (where I'll be based for which days) organising my travel- flights etc 
Is a weekday different to the weekend? If yes, how so? 
Yes- I don't usually work, but on occasion I will have to do some hours or manage a weekend event 
How do you spend your free time? 
Exercising, shopping, socializing 
Thinking about tasks that you perform, which ones are the most important for you to keep track of? 
Food shopping, exercise. Day to day stuff like plans to meet people, calls I need to make. Tickets I need to book (for work- travel etc) 

What do you find hardest about managing your time? 
I'm very forgetful, and can be unorganised when I have too much work to do. I leave things until the last minute 
Please can you give some examples? 
I forget to cancel subscriptions for free trials, pay fines (parking tickets!) Birthday and Christmas presents- I have ideas for presents and then I forget the ideas. Then I forget to buy them in time. 
Can you tell me about how you currently manage your time? (potential probes/elaboration: do you use any specific methods or tools to aid you trackingyour TM? If yes: what are they? If no: reason why not? Have they ever tried in the 
past?) 
I use to do lists- apps mainly for work. For social I use calendars- different apps. Combined with my bad memory! 
What time management methods have you tried in the past? 
Todoist, a do to app. Fantastical, another app. I've tried loads of apps. For work, project planning apps- Asana etc 
What caused you to stop using them? 
The time I spent using them was unproductive- spent too long. I want something straight forward and easy to use. 
Where do you go to find time management advice? (Friends/family? Internet? Books?) 
Articles, online interviews (not really magazine paper articles) friend recommendations- what people have suggested that works for them 
What do you/would you look for when searching for time management advice? 
A quick fix! Something thats easy to use, simple- the problem is that there is a lot of information out there, there are too many to chose from. I've gone through a lot of apps that just haven't worked for me. 
Following question: Do you have a plan? How do you set your plan? Details about duration, habits etc. Techniques or apps that are used. /If no, why? 
I tend not to plan- I just wing it. It depends what I'm focusing on- not necessarily what is important! I tend not to make plans because if things change I have to respond to it quickly. It also depends on my focus. 
How do you feel about your planning and time-managing? 
When I do it properly it's effective, I just don't always do it properly! [How I feel towards time managing tools] I don't want to use any tools that I have to pay for!
