**Time Management Potential User Interview** 
*Thank you for helping us with our research in to how people manage their time! In this interview we will ask some questions about yourself, and your thoughts around managing your time- there are no right or wrong answers.* 
**Introduction** 

**To begin, can you please tell me what a typical day looks like for you? (potential probes: working or studying? full/part time?)** 
I get up and work out in the morning, get ready for work (shower, brush teeth etc) then get to work. Maybe do some work in the evening, have food at some point. Sometimes meet up with friends/girlfriend in the evening. 
**If working: can you tell me a bit about the industry that you work in and your job role?**
I work full time from home, in the tech industry as a software engineer 
What kind of tasks do you perform the most? (if needed can prompt: working, studying, childcare, shopping, etc) 
I work out a lot, interesting work tasks (ones that I enjoy and want to complete) and non group tasks (Individual work related tasks that I can do on my own) 
Is a weekday different to the weekend? If yes, how so? 
Yes its different, I don't (usually) work on the weekends, although sometimes I do. I sleep a lot more 
ï¿¼ 
How do you spend your free time? 
Still mostly on the computer, or working out. I like reading, wasting time on the internet. Hanging out with my friends or my girlfriend 
Tasks 
Thinking about tasks that you perform, which ones are the most important to you? 
Work tasks, personal tasks that I have to complete- e.g 'life admin'- taxes, bills, organising appointments etc 
What are the tasks that you would most like to keep track of and why? (Are they different to the previous question? If so, why?) 
They are the same as my important ones 
What do you find hardest about managing your time? 
I tend to have too many projects at once (work and personal) and I don't have enough time 
Please can you give some examples? 
Work is very busy and I take on more than I should. I also leave my personal tasks to mount up (e.g taxes) and then I have a lot to do at once 
Managing time 
Can you tell me about how you currently manage your time? (potential probes/elaboration: do you use any specific methods or tools to aid you tracking your TM? If yes: what are they? If no: reason why not? Have they ever tried in the past?) 
I use a digital calendar, I write lists- both paper and digital, I use sticky notes around my desk/computer 
Where do you go to find time management advice? (Friends/family? Internet? Books?) 
Internet, mostly podcasts- Tim Ferris ha a podcast where he discusses how you can optimize everything- including time management etc. He'll interview guests and I get good advice from them. The School of Greatness is another podcast I listen to. 
What do you/would you look for when searching for time management advice? 
Something that is easy to use- very straight forward. I don't want to rely on one app to do everything and store everything in one place 
(If applicable from the first question) What time management methods have you tried in the past? 
Apps mainly, Wunderlist, Trello, Jira, various other to-do list style apps 
(If applicable to previous question) What caused you to stop using them? 
All the information was stored in one place and I wanted to be able to apply it in different areas of my life. I want everything as plain and simple as possible, not 'lock in'- I don't want all the information stuck in one app, I want to be able to apply to my calendar etc 
How do you process your tasks? 
Following question: Do you have a plan? How do you set your plan? Details about duration, habits etc. Techniques or apps that are used. /If no, why? 
I try to usually plan my day ahead in the morning, and plan my week ahead on a Sunday- I don't always do it though. Use my calendar, write lists- when I stick to it. Sometimes I forget or get distracted. I don't currently have an app that I use- haven't found the right one 
How do you feel about your planning and time-managing? 
Neutral- its something that needs to be done. I don't hate it, but I don't love it 
Do you used to set a goal for yourself regarding your job or study? If not, why? If yes, how? 
Yes- I set actionable goals. So not states of where to be, but things I can do. Not outcome oriented (not directly at least) 
What is your strategy to manage the workload? How do you manage it? 
Don't really have one. As I said, take on too much all the time. 
What is their attitude in this situation? How does their attitude make them feel? 
Constantly tired and frustrated that I can't get everything done. 
How do you adapt when changes occur in your plan? 
I just have to get on with it!
