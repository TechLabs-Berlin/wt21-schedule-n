**Project Brief:** 

Create an app to empower users to receive useful advice for managing their time based on their personality. 

**Introduction:**

In this project we are trying to help our target group to get advice regarding Time Managements types. Our target group has trouble managing their time. For solving their problem, they mostly use apps or do a test which does not work for them. They dont work because these solutions are so general. Our product tries to solve this problem by providing users with more specific advice based on their personality and time management criteria.
 
**Solutions:**
1. Take quiz.  
2. Get TM type.  
3. Learn about their TM type and receive advice.  
 
V.1, V.2: In version 1 users learn about their TM type and get some advice related to their TM type. In version 2 we will provide users with more advice related to their TM type from other sources and real people who have scored the same.
 
**Mision:**

Our mission is to help people improve their knowledge about themselves regarding time management to be more productive and use their time better in line with their personality and situation.
